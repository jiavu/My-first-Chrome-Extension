- add border radius!

- Maybe remove browser_action and replace with page_action.
  Add background script that filters events (restrict page to helpcenter url only).
    Is it declarativeContent?


- Add a 2nd button: copy link and close tab !!!		(chrome event?)
	I am sure the contenscript.js has to send a message to a background script for this.


- Add Shortcut listeners to contentscript.js (possible?). call function(s) via Shortcut(s).
